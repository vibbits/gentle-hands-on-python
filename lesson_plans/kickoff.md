# Kickoff notes

## Objectives
1. Introduce trainers and students
1. Course organisation and timeline
   1. One month with 3 Q&A sessions for you to work on projects and ask questions directly.
   1. Times and link are always the same:
      - 21/Jan
      - 28/Jan
      - 4/Feb
1. Set and reinforce expectations
   - Go through questionaire responses
   - Note that we know students are time constrained
1. Familiarise students with Dodona
1. Join Hedy and send me username to add to class

## Introductions

Trainers then students introduce themselves:

- name
- what I do
- an interesting fact

## Organisation

What we're trying to do with this course is give you a starting off point to learn programming.
Not even necessarily Python, but Python is a useful language to start with especially in the
bio-sciences.

The course is intended for _new_ programmers. Not all of you are new to programming, and some
of you have even used Python before. If this is you, please feel free to skip ahead to the more
useful sections of the course. If you are new to programming then we hope you will find the fun
and usefulness of programming.

The course is broadly organised into 3 parts:
1. The fundamentals of computation common to all programming technologies.
1. The details of solving a problem using features of the Python programming language.
1. Some "real world" strategies and techniques that you will often need as a programmer. 

## Expectations

* Start by sharing the screen on the questionnaire statistics.
* Most important points to emphasise:
  * 4 weeks is a laughably short time to learn any skill, let alone programming.
  * We do not expect you to be an expert programmer and "know" Python after the course. This
    is merely an introduction to get you started. However, you will be able to do useful things,
    even very early in the course.
  * We know you are very busy. So we've set up the course so that you can work on it as and when
    you have time. The email states that the Q&A sessions are mandatory. As far as I'm concerned
    this is a very soft mandatory. BUT: we are trying to push you to practice. The more you practice
    the better in every way. If treating these sessions as mandatory helps push you to practice
    then treat them as mandatory.
  * I expect you to invest at least 2 hours a week outside the Q&A sessions attempting exercises
    youreself. You can use Dodona (or email) to ask questions at any time. I will check for questions
    every day so the longest you should have to wait for an answer should be 24 hours.
  * During the Q&A session, we can start private rooms on Jitsi if you are uncomfortable asking publicly.
  * Please ask for help _when_ (not if) you get stuck. The downside of running a course online is that
    we cannot see you when you get stuck. So please help us help you by telling us. In fact, asking
    questions is a really powerful method to problem solve: the process of writing out your question
    can often reveal the answer without even having to send the question to us.
    
### Use of large language models like ChatGPT

We strongly discourage you from using this type assistant for your learning. You will not be penalised
by us, but you are doing yourself a dis-service. You will be faster and more confident if you actually
try to understand what the course is trying to teach. This is _not_ to say that the course is perfect,
I would be grateful for any feedback you have which would help you to better understand the material.

## Dodona

[Dodona invite link](https://dodona.be/en/courses/5743/?secret=FkDvn)
Ask students to login to Dodona (make sure they can).
Share screen for Dodona (in anonymous mode).

The course is divided into 8 major sections covering gradually more advanced topics.
Each section builds on the previous to introduce new techniques and ideas. These
sections contain 2 types of lessons: reading lessons and exercises. Some of the earlier
reading lessons even have a video (I just haven't had the time to edit all of the videos yet).
In these videos myself and my dear friend Nina (who is no longer involved in teaching this course)
guide you through the topic of the lesson. What we cover in the video is also covered in the text
so you can choose which is best for you (at least in the earlier lessons).

Demonstrate asking and answering questions (help from assistant).

## Hedy

If you are new to programming, it can be useful to start by understanding what it means
to "think like a programmer". For this we use "Hedy". Hedy is a "gradual" and fun introduction to
programming. You can even use your native language. Hedy has many levels, but you should only
complete level 4 before returning to Dodona.

You should now register on Hedy and send us your username so that we can add you to the
classroom.

## Projects

There are currently 4 pre-defined "projects". These are substantial "realistic" problems that can be
solved by what you learn in this course. The idea is to demonstrate to you that you can solve real
problems even with the small experience you gain from this course. And your abilities can only improve!
You can start working on a project after you complete the "Fundamentals" section on Dodona.
