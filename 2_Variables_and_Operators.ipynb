    "Just printing things is not that interesting, what you really want to do with a computer program is manipulate data. This is why variables are so important - they allow you to assign information to a name that you can re-use later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will introduce the basic types of variables and how you can manipulate them. Just to get started, we give an overview of the different **built-in data types** that are present in Python and which you can assign to a variable. Although this variety of data types exist, not all of them will be discussed in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text type:       `str`\n",
    "- Numeric types:   `int`, `float`, `complex`\n",
    "- Sequence types:  `list`, `tuple`, `range`\n",
    "- Mapping types:   `dict`\n",
    "- Set types:       `set`, `frozenset`\n",
    "- Boolean types:   `bool`\n",
    "- Binary types:    `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will cover the text type, numeric types (complex are out of scope) and booleans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Operators** can be anything from:\n",
    "- Arithmetic: additions, substractions, multiplications, divisions, remainders and power\n",
    "- Comparison: equal to, not equal to, greater than, less than, etc. \n",
    "- Logical: AND, OR and NOT used for conditional statements\n",
    "- Identity: `is`, `is not`\n",
