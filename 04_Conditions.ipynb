It can be played with 1 or more people and involves taking turns to count up from `1`. If the number is a multiple of `3`, you don't say the number, instead you say \"Fizz\". If the number is a multiple of `5` you say \"Buzz\". Finally, if the number is a multiple of `3` **and** `5` you say \"Fizz Buzz\".\n",
