    "Your programs can and will crash. This can be because of logical errors in the code (which can be fixed), or because an unexpected value creeps into a variable from misguided user input or a file that has strange values in it (this you cannot fix).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last category of problems, it is useful to doublecheck variables that you cannot fully control - sometimes you want to just warn the user that something strange is happening, sometimes you want to stop the code because you can't continue with this information. What is best depends on how user-friendly you want the program to be, and how much effort you can spare - it takes a lot of time to do this correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "One very useful command to check values is **assert**, another that you can use to avoid running into errors is the **try: except:** combination, which we'll introduce here.\n",
