    "`open()` only creates a connection to a file. The next step is to _read_ data from the file (i.e. to get the data out so\n",
    "you can work with it). In order to read in a file, there are a couple of possibilities:\n",
    "- `readline()` - read the first line of the file as one string.\n",
    "- `readlines()` - read all of the lines in the file. Each line is one string. The lines are combined as a list of lines (strings). \n",
    "- `read()` - read the whole file as one string. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has its trade-offs and you will have to consider which is most appropriate for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example use cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you're searching for the presence of a word or string in a file, given that the file is not too big, you can use `read()`.\n",
    "\n",
