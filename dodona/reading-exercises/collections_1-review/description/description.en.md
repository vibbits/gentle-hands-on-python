In this chapter you learned how to store multiple values into an ordered, mutable collection called
a `list`. You learned how to access individual values and slices of values. You also learned how to
sort lists and check for membership in a list. And also that strings can be operated on in a similar
way to lists when using the index and slice operators



## Review Questions


<details>
    <summary>What are lists used for?</summary>
    To collect values together. 
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What does it mean for a list to be mutable?</summary>
    A value can be changed after creation. The assignment operator (<code>=</code>) works.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Is a string (<code>str</code>) like a list?</summary>
  Yes. In the sense that strings can be indexed and sliced. They're collections
  of only characters though. And strings are immutable. You cannot assign to a
  string index.

    Slicing is a way to access ranges of elements in a list (or string).
