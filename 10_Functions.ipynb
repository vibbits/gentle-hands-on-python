    "So far we've been writing 'sequential' code, basically following the flow of the code from the top to the bottom of the program. Sometimes, however, you want to re-use code elsewhere without copy/pasting. You can do this with functions; a function holds a block of code that can be called from other places. Functions are essential for larger projects and code maintenance - if there's a problem with that piece of code, for example, you only have to fix it in one place.\n",

    "## 10.2 Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already been using built-in Python functions, for example **print()** or **len()**. However, in this section we will build our own functions. Generally, the syntax when calling a function is the name of the function followed by parentheses **( )**. When you're writing your own function, this is preceded by the `def` keyword like so:\n",
    ":\n",
    "```python\n",

    "In the example above there are `3` arguments called `some`, `function`, and `arguments`. The string immediately after\n",
