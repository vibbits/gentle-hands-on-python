    "## Situation\n",
    "Mutations in the *BRCA* genes are known to increase the susceptibility of developing cancer. The *BRCA* gene test is a blood test that uses DNA analysis to identify harmful changes (mutations) in either one of the two breast cancer susceptibility genes — BRCA1 and BRCA2 [[1]](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet). In this project exercise, we will mimic this test (or at least how it could look like). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "We've obtained a [coding sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_region) (DNA) from two patients and we also have the functional protein sequence of BRCA2. Our goal is to identify [non-silent mutations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_mutation) in the sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will write a program that reads in a fasta file, extracts the sequence, transcribes and translates it into protein sequences. As it is possible that there are sequencing errors in the beginning, we will take into account that there are [frameshifts](https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Frameshift-Mutation) and therefore also different [ORFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_reading_frame#:~:text=In%20molecular%20genetics%2C%20an%20open,UAA%2C%20UAG%20or%20UGA). We will assess all ORFs in the sequence, store all possible proteins and then compare them with the reference protein sequence of a functional BRCA2 protein. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the different steps:\n",
    "- Read in the fasta file, extract the sequence\n",
    "- Transcribe the sequence to RNA sequence\n",
    "- Translate the RNA sequence depending on the frameshift\n",
    "- A valid peptide/protein starts with a Methionine and ends at a stop sequence. Extract all valid peptides from a protein sequence. \n",
    "- For each peptide/protein, check if the length is equal to the reference BRCA2 protein sequence and if so, calculate the [hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) and extract the location as well as the mutation itself if there was any. "
