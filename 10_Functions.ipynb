    "So far we've been writing 'sequential' code, basically following the flow of the code from the top to the bottom of the program. Sometimes, however, you want to re-use code elsewhere without copy/pasting a bit of code. You can do this with functions; a function holds a block of code that can be called from other places. Functions are essential for larger projects and code maintenance - if there's a problem with that piece of code, for example, you only have to fix it in one place.\n",

    "## 10.2 Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already been using built-in Python functions, for example **abs()** or **len()**. However, in this section we will build our own functions. Generally, the syntax when calling a function is the name of the function followed by round brackets **( )**. When you're writing your own function, in essence it would look like this\n",

    "def name_function():\n",
    "    \"Some information about the function\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print(\"This is a very simple function\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Information is given to a function by means of an argument and this is passed on in the rounded brackets. In the example above an argument is not defined, hence whenever you call the function it will print the same text. Arguments are defined within the parenthesis and are separated by commas in case there are multiple arguments. Before exploiting functions with arguments, let's have a look to an example with no arguments that prints the same text always when you call the function. "
